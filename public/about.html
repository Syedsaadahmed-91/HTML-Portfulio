<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I enjoy solving problems by breaking them down into clear, logical steps. Whether I’m working through technical challenges, exploring new ideas, or refining systems, I focus on finding solutions that are practical and easy to apply.
</p>

<p>I’m curious by nature and always looking for ways to simplify complexity. I like turning difficult concepts into something structured and actionable, whether that’s through technology, analysis, or creative problem‑solving.</p>

<p>For me, growth means building habits and strategies that last. I believe progress isn’t just about fixing what’s in front of me—it’s about creating systems that bring clarity, confidence, and resilience over time.
